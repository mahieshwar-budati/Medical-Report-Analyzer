### Final Diagnosis:

* **Anxiety Disorder**: The patient's history of anxiety, family history of generalized anxiety disorder, and current symptoms of intense chest pain, heart palpitations, and fear of having a heart attack may indicate an underlying anxiety disorder, such as panic disorder, as noted by the Psychologist Report. The Cardiologist Report also suggests that anxiety-related symptoms may be contributing to the patient's episodes of chest pain, palpitations, and shortness of breath.
* **Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)**: The patient's GERD could be causing chest pain and discomfort, which may be exacerbated by stress and anxiety, as mentioned in the Cardiologist Report. The Pulmonologist Report also suggests that GERD may be triggering respiratory issues, highlighting the need for further evaluation and management of this condition.
* **Hyperventilation Syndrome**: The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath, dizziness, and sweating could be related to hyperventilation syndrome, which may be triggered by anxiety and stress, as noted in the Cardiologist Report and Pulmonologist Report. This condition may be contributing to the patient's respiratory symptoms and exacerbating their anxiety disorder.
